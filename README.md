Abstract:
Recent single-cell multi-omic and spatial analyses of synovial biopsies have transformed
our understanding of myeloid cell–driven mechanisms underlying human joint pathology and
tissue homeostasis in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the developmental trajectories of
synovial tissue macrophage (STM) subsets in humans remain poorly understood, due in part to the
lack of models that faithfully replicate synovial tissue niches. This hinders the exploration of the
therapeutic potential of targeting specific synovial myeloid cell clusters. Using multi-omics
analyses of synovial tissue from an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient, we show that
joint-specific tissue-resident STM subsets, including both health- and disease-associated clusters,
can derive from peripheral blood monocytes. Analysis of embryonic synovial joints revealed that
macrophage localization and maturation in the joints are preceded by local stromal niche
specialisation, indicating that synovial fibroblasts (FLS) provide tissue-specific instructive cues to
STM precursors. To elucidate human STM developmental trajectories, we established a SNP-
based fate-tracking human synovial organoid system by embedding distinct blood-derived myeloid
precursors, together with FLS clusters from RA synovial biopsies and endothelial cells, into 3D
structures. These organoids reproduced key synovial tissue features, including lining and sublining
architecture and stromal–myeloid cell cluster composition. Importantly, they supported
differentiation of all resident STM subsets: homeostatic lining TREM2pos macrophages, their
pathogenic TREM2lowSPP1pos counterparts that characterize the RA hyperplastic lining, and both
homeostatic and RA-associated perivascular LYVE1pos STM clusters, all traced to monocytic
precursors. In summary, we show that development of STM subsets is driven by fibroblast-
conditioned spatial niches. We have established a novel, tractable ex vivo platform to dissect the
niche-specific cues driving homeostatic versus pathogenic phenotypic clusters.
